      hello, this is yogit and Today I am going to tell you my coding advice in
      which I will tell you the order to learn the languages.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li class="first-li">
        Python. Python is recommended for all the beginners because it is eadsy
        and powerful. this will adapt to the computer languages so then you can
        learn other languages also.
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are recommended because without them you
        can't build and website. So if you want to make a good website you can't
        do it without HTML and CSS. HTMl stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
        and CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
